## Projects that are Comming Up
---

### Fluid Dynamics
---
- Re-developing the ___NavierStokes-2D-ChannelFlow___ __Fortran Solver__ from a __Serial__ to a __Parallel__ version, making use of __OOP__ techniques and the __OpenMP__ API.

  
- ___fastFLOW___: a solver for either ___burgerFLOW___ or ___viscousRiver___, using the __SYCL Framework__, the __Finite Element Method__ and the __Eigen C++ Template Library__. Initially this will be a project that looks at applying __Heterogeneous Computing__ to __Fluid Dynamics__. If this works out, I'd like to incorporate some sort of __Neural Network__.


- ___lidFlowFVM___. This is a __C++__ solver, which models __Lid-Driven Cavity Flow__. The __Discretization Method__ used will be the __Finite Volume Method (FVM)__. Everything else will be developed by myself.
- Developing __Unit Tests__ for a number of solvers developed in __C__. See repositories from __High Performance Computing Applications for Physical Simulation__. 
- A __Dynamic Library__ called ___cfvmLib___, developed in __C++__, (hopefully __C++20__), for problems in ___Fluid Dynamics___. The __Discretization Method__ used will be the __Finite Volume Method (FVM)__. __Linear__ problems will be tackled first; hopefully __Non-Linear__ problems will be tackled not too far down the line!

### Scientific HPC
---
- __Heterogeneous Programming__: Using __SYCL__ to develop a __Numerical Solver__ for the __Linear 2D Heat/Diffusion Equation__. Could be any __Partial Differential Equation__; TBC.

### Signal Processing
---
- ___sigPro___. This is a __Dynamic Library (.SO)__ developed in __Modern C++__, (hopefully __C++20__), which allows the user to perform basic __Signal Processing__ tasks. E.g. converting __temporal data into frequency data__ via the __Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)__.

- ___fastDFT___. Using __OpenCL__ to develop a solver for the __Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)__.

 


### Systems Programming
---
- __Linux Kernel__ called ___basix___.
- __Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces__. I've been meaning to read this for years!
- __Compiler__ using __C__. Language implementation will (hopefully) be with __Rust__. 
- __Operating System__ developed in __Rust__. Project Name: ___ros___.
- __RDBMS (SQL)__ developed in __C++__. Hopefully look at doing this with __C++20__. Project Name: ___CDB++___. 
- __Distributed File System__ development in __Golang__. Project Name: ___GoDistIt___.
- __Rust__ version of __Git__. Project Name: ___RustIt___.
- __Compiler Development__ using __LLVM__.
